# üêç Introductory Python Programming
M.4 Semester 1 Coursework

This repository is dedicated to storing all **classwork and homework** completed during the first semester of my **Artificial Intelligence Engineering** major. It serves as a comprehensive record of fundamental programming concepts learned in Python.

## üìö Key Topics Covered

* ### **Fundamentals**
    Comments, variables, data types (strings, booleans, type casting), input/output, operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment), indentation, and membership.

* ### **Data Structures**
    Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

* ### **Control Flow**
    Conditional statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and control keywords (`break`, `continue`, `pass`).

* ### **Functions**
    Defining and calling functions, positional and keyword arguments, arbitrary arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`), and Lambda functions.

* ### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    Classes & objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

* ### **Modules & Libraries**
    Importing modules, aliasing, and examples of built-in/custom modules (e.g., `Math`, `Random`, `Tkinter`, `JSON`, `OS`).
